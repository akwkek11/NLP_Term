and y ' know , even if they break up again , you ' d better not let him in your sad men ' s club !
divorced men ' s club .
potato , potaato .
why isn ' t that valet back with my porsche ?
maybe because you ' ve got the keys ?

the woman from the museum called and said that there was a cancellation and that we could move up our wedding and chandler heard !
i know !

damnit , damnit , damnit , damnit .
this is all your fault .
this is supposed to be , like , the greatest day of my life , y ' know ?
my son is being born , and i should be in there , you know , instead of stuck in a closet with you .
the woman i love is having a baby today . i ' ve been waiting for this just as much as you have .
no no no , believe me .
no one has been waiting for this as much as i have , ok ?
and you know what the funny thing is ?
when this day is over , you get to go home with the baby , ok ?
where does that leave me ?
you get to be the baby ' s father .
everyone knows who you are .
who am i ?
there ' s mother ' s day , there ' s father ' s day , there ' s no . lesbian lover day .
every day is lesbian lover day .
this is so great .
you wanna explain that ?
i mean , well , ' cause when i was growing up , you know my dad left , and my mother died , and my stepfather went to jail , so i barely had enough pieces of parents to make one whole one .
and here ' s this little baby who has like three whole parents who care about it so much that they ' re fighting over who gets to love it the most .
and it ' s not even born yet .
it ' s just , it ' s just the luckiest baby in the whole world .
i ' m sorry , you were fighting .
okay , it ' s a typical new york city apartment . two girls are just hanging out .

i don ' t need you or anybody else !
i ' m gonna make it on my own !
you ' ll see !

i can ' t believe that ross is gone . it is just so sad .
i didn ' t know ross and you were so close .
we weren ' t but we had one class together . he was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science . i always remembered him .
i ' m sure that would mean a lot to him .
and if heaven has a door , i ' m sure he ' s pressing his ear up against it and listening intently .
i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out . i guess i really missed my chance .
but you didn ' t !
i ' m still alive !
kori , i know this is a big surprise for you .
it ' s a long story but the things you just said really made my day !
i mean , the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people !
you sick freak , who does that ? i can ' t believe i had a crush on you !
did you hear that ? kori weston had a crush on me !
we ' ll do a quick check .
okay .
so , eight days late huh ?
yeah .
you must be a little uncomfortable .
eh , just a tad .
you ' re about 80 percent effaced , so you ' re on your way .
it still could last a little while longer .
if you ' re anxious there are a few ways to help things along .
do them !
actually , they ' re things you can do . just some home remedies , but in my experience i ' ve found that some of them are quite effective .
well , we are ready to try anything .
okay , there ' s an herbal tea you can drink .
okay .
what is wrong with emma ?
oh she misunderstood , she thought she was moving to tulsa .
anytime you ' re ready .
ok , ok , here we go .
ok , where am i talking to , here ?
i mean , uh , well , there is one way that seems to offer a certain acoustical advantage , but .
just aim for the bump .
ok , ok , ok , ok , here goes .
you know , i , you know , can ' t do this .
uh , this is too weird .
i feel stupid .
so don ' t do it , it ' s fine . you don ' t have to do it just because susan does it .

oh , okay that explains it .
i got a call at two in the morning , but all i could hear was , like , this high squeaky sound , so i thought okay its like a mouse or a opossum .
but then i realized where would a mouse or a opossum get the money to make the phone call .
so uh , man , are you gonna go to the play with me tonight ?
y ' know what , i don ' t know how comfortable i am going to see how hot the sex is between some guy and your girlfriend .

yeah . ooh , and i know gail rosten is in there twice , but she is so
oh , i know . y ' know , just - just talking about it is getting me kinda
oh , me too .
and then , we could ' ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar !
ross , it just wouldn ' t have been feasible .
but having a dove place the ring on your finger would ' ve been no problem ?
it was really fun being married to you tonight .
yeah ! and ! and , it was the easiest 400 bucks i ' ve ever made .
okay ross , can i uh , can i ask you something ?
yeah .
that proposal , at the planetarium
i know , i know it was stupid .

with the , with the lilies , and - and the song , and the stars !
it wasreally wonderful !
did you just make that up ?
no , actually i thought about it when , when we were going out .
it ' s how i imagined i uh , i would ask you to marry me .
well , that would ' ve been very hard to say no too .
it ' s a good thing i didn ' t do it , because it sounds like it would ' ve been a very expensive wedding . okay , good night
goodnight
even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn ' t get messed up ?
i will think about it .
that ' s all i ' m askin '
you guys ! it was bananas , cream , and beef ! i - i just cannot believe that you ate that so that i wouldn ' t feel bad !

well , i , umm

phoebe , that is juice , squeezed from a person .
what is the big deal ?
what did you just do ?
ok , would people stop drinking the breast milk ?
you won ' t even taste it ?

that ' s funny .
hey pheebs , could you please not put your feet up on my newold sheet ?
oh sure ! noo !
ohh !
my apothecary table !

how is she ?
it ' s too soon to tell . she ' s resting , which is a good sign .
how ' s the hair ?
i ' m not gonna lie to you , ross , it doesn ' t look good .
i put a clip on one side , which seems to have stopped the curling .
can we see her ?
your hair looks too good , i think it would upset her . ross , why don ' t you come on in .
yeah .
how ' re you doing ?
of course the packaging does appeal to grown - ups and kids alike .
ross , you ' re being silly . i ' ve tried it , it ' s no big deal . just taste it .
that would be no .
come on . it doesn ' t taste bad .
yeah , it ' s kinda sweet , sorta like , uh .
cantaloupe juice .

uh huh .
oh , you ' ve tasted it .
you can keep saying it , but it won ' t stop being true .
gimme the bottle . gimme the towel .
