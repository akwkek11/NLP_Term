hello skidmark .
it ' s a nickname , i ' ll explain later .
it ' s pretty clear .

hi everyone .
i just , i wanted to thank you for our uh , our little talk before .
oh , god , no problem . so you ' re gonna go with the uh , waiting thing ?
well , i was going to , but after i talked to you , i talked to joey .
what did , what did he say ?
basically he told me to get over myself and just do it , ya know .
so i though about what you said and i though about what he said and , well , his way i get to have sex tonight so .
.
.
oh , great !
we couldn ' t keep our eyes off each other all night and then every once and a while y ' know , he ' d kinda lean over and stroke my hair and touch my neck .
okay , stop it phoebe , you ' re getting me all tingly .
all i could think of was y ' know , " is he gonna kiss me ? is he gonna kiss me ? "
and did he ?
i ' m a lady monica , i don ' t kiss and tell . but this hickey speaks for itself .
okay - okay , i got it . i got it .
i just like him so much that i just feel like i ' ve had 10 drinks today and i ' ve only had six .
oh , i haven ' t had that feeling since i first started going out with chandler .
wow , i ' m never gonna have that feeling again , am i ?
you sound like a guy .
no , a guy would be saying , " i ' m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else . "
oh my god !
i ' m never gonna get to sleep with anyone else !
i ' ve been so busy planning the wedding that i forgot about all the things that i ' d be giving up !
i mean , ii ' m never gonna have a first kiss again .
you ' ll have a last kiss .
thank you so much for coming back over .
oh good , you ' re here . yeah , and i was worried that it was going to be uncomfortable .

oh , i ' m sorry . i didn ' t hear you over all the winning .
chandler ! phoebe ' s hogging the game !
remember i had to leave the room the other day when you had that roast chicken ?
yeah . but i thought that was because i put the whole thing on my hand and made it walk across the table .
anyway , it just doesn ' t seem worth it to make a whole turkey for just three people . okay ? it ' s a lot of work .
but you gotta have turkey on thanksgiving !
i mean , thanksgiving with no turkey is like - like fourth of july with no apple pie !
or friday with no two pizzas !
all right fine ! if it means that much to you ! but justthere ' s gonna be a ton left over .
no there won ' t ! i promise i will finish that turkey !
all right , you ' re telling me you can eat an entire turkey in just one sitting ?
that ' s right !
cause i ' m a tribbiani !
and this is what we do !
i mean we may not be great thinkers or world leaders , we don ' t read a lot or run very fast , but damnit !
we can eat !
well ?

let me ask you some questions about , is it , uh , marcel ?
yes .
does he , uh , fight with other animals ?
no - no , he ' s , he ' s very docile .
even if he were . cornered ?
well i , i don ' t know . why ?
uh , how is he at handling small objects ?
he can hold a banana , if that ' s whatcha mean .
how about a hammer , or a small blade ?
why - why - why would he need a blade ?
well , if he ' s up against a jungle cat or an animal with horns , you ' ve got to give the little guy something .
otherwise it ' s just cruel .
he - he - he got in , he - he got in to san diego .
we , we come back from our walk and the - the phone was ringing .
. he ' s in .
he ' s in ! oh , did you hear that , marcel ? san diego . san diego !
you ' re making a big mistake here .
i mean , san diego ' s all well and good , but if you give him to me , i ' ll start him off against a blind rabbit and give you twenty percent of the gains .
my specimen is in the room and i just want to thank whoever knocked on the door while i was in there .
really helped speed the process along !
janice !

but you - you - you could write that umm , your love lets me orbit the moon twice and return safely .

because it says " captain ross " on the side and " i hate monica " on the bottom .
yeah , see ya .

and - and to be honest , i - i still have feelings for you .
and i wish that we can work it out ross , but we can ' t .

oh god you ' re right .
ross , wewe have to be strong . okay , i - i ' m gonna go . can i ? to remember you ?
no .
i ' m telling you , if you want to take care of that thing , you should go to my herbal guy .
thank you , but i want to remove it pheebs . i don ' t want to make it savory .
y ' know when girls sleep with guys with weird things on their body , they tell their friends about it .
gimme this .
hi ! okay , don ' t be mad at me , but i couldn ' t resist .
brides magazines ?
yes , and i know that you ' d say no if he asked you , but i ' m sorry ; how great would you look walking down the aisle in this donna carin .
oh , you so would ! oh , you should get that anyway . like for clubbing .
it is so weird , i know what i said , but uh , this morning , i was lying in bed i was , i was imagining what it would be like to say yes .
i know it ' s a little sudden , and it ' s a little rushed , and it ' s totally not like me to do something like this , but that doesn ' t mean i can ' t .
right ?
i mean i ' m - i ' m crazy about pete , and i know that we want the same things , and when i thought about saying yes , it made me really happy .
oh my god .
i know . i need more pie .
hey mon umm , if you do get married , can i bring two guests ?
you didn ' t break up with that fireman ?
no , that was my way of telling you .
well , it turns out he ' s incredibly sensitive , he keeps a journal and he paints .
he even showed me charcoal drawings that he drew of me .
wow !
yeah , well he ' d prefer water colors , but y ' know , he has easy access to a lot of charcoal .
so then , are you going to dump jason ?
well , yeah , because i have to break up with someone , and okay so jason is sensitive , but now so ' s vince plus , vince has the body y ' know ?
so it ' s really just about the math .
ok , so it ' s a tie again , 41 to 41 .
ok , look ! enough is enough !
no , i have just to have two more points to beat him !
monica , that was also true an
i can ' t just walk away ! i ' ve put in four hours !
but .
look !
you knew this about me when you married me !
you agreed to take me in sickness and in health .
well , this is my sickness !
oh yeah - yeah , the lobster .
yeah , i mean i was up sick all night .
yeah me too , all night .
really ! how come we didn ' t cross paths ?
yeah well that ' s because uhi stayed in my room . yeah , you don ' t want to look in my hamper .
i can ' t believe there is a naked hooker in there !
wait ! wait ! maybe she ' s a hooker
yeah , okay let ' s leave these two alone .
no ! i do not care what my hormones are doing , i am not going to just do it with some random guy !
fine ! then you tell roger because he was really looking forward to this !
so .
so .
i just thought the two of us should hang out for a bit .
i mean , you know , we ' ve never really talked .
i guess you ' d know that , being one of the two of us , though , right ?
i know , i probably shouldn ' t even tell you this , but i ' m pretty much totally intimidated by you .
really ? me ?
yes .
oh my god , are you kidding ?
ross is so crazy about you , and i really wanted you to like me , and , it ' s probably me being totally paranoid , but i kinda got the feeling that maybe you don ' t .
well , you ' re not totally paranoid .
oy .
um , ok , uh , oh god , um , when you and uh ross first started going out , it was really hard for me , um , for many reasons , which i ' m not gonna bore you with now , but um , i just , i see how happy he is , you know , and how good you guys are together , and um , monica ' s always saying how nice you are , and god i hate it when she ' s right .
thanks . hey , listen , would you like to go to a movie sometime or something ?
yeah , that ' d be great . i ' d love it .

thank you .
filing system ?
oh - oh !
you mean those - those little colored labels you put on all the folders ?
it certainly did brighten up the inside of the filing cabinets .
well , they uh , they - they do more than that .
i notice that you ' ve been trusted with a lot of rather important responsibilities .
yes , joanna really has been an incredible mentor to me .
oh . and rachel has been really incredible in getting my morning bagel for me . it ' s amazing how she gets it right almost
i - i - i of course , i have more responsibilities than that .
oh yes , well there ' s the coffee too . rachel can carry two things at once !
yes , that ' s very good . now a uh , big part of this job is cultivating personal relationships , especially with designers .
yes , i realize that
and rachel shouldn ' t have any problem with that . the only problem might be getting a little too friendly , if you know what i mean .
i love working with designers !
with them , under them , what ' s the difference ? eh , rach ?
chandler , you have an assistant right ?
did she call ? you - you told her i was sick right ? always tell her i am sick !
chandler , listen to me sweetie , i know you can do this . okay ? you have a beautiful smile .

where ' s chandler ?
here i am .
wash your hands !
how did youknow ?
hey ! what ' s she doing back here ?
relax , ross . she ' s not made of ice cream !
hey look , phoebe . i , uh , i laid out the states geographically .

well , chandler and i are in a bar
did you not hear me say , " du - ude ! "
and this girl is making eyes at chandler , okay ?
so after awhile he - he goes over to her and uh , after a minute or two , i see them kissing .
now , i know what you ' re thinking , chandler ' s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out with girls , and you ' re right , chandler ' s not the type of guy who just goes to bars and makes out withgirls .
you kissed a guy ! oh my god .
in my defense , it was dark and he was a very pretty guy .
oh mon , i laughed so hard
ho - ho , so hard we had to throw out your underwear again ?
whatever dude , you kissed a guy .
so umm , you ' re gonna stay with me as long as i need you ?
of course i am !
oh mom , i swear i ' m not an idiot .
i ' ve read all kinds of books on pregnancy and giving birth , but i - i just didn ' t think to read the part about what to do when the baby comes .
and - and then guess what ?
the baby ' s coming and i don ' t know what to do .
oh , can i throw up in my diaper genie ?
no . sweetie , you ' re gonna be fine .
wait - wait where are you going ? where are you going ?
i ' m going to the bathroom .
okay .
now don ' t worry ! everything ' s gonna be okay .
it
hey !
hey ! why are you all red and sweaty ?
i just bamboozled chandler ! which is not uh sexual thing . that was a quick shower .
not if you were here .
okay , the reason why i asked you guys out to brunch today is because i have been doing some thinking about who should be my maid of honor .
oh my god ! this is it ! i really hope it ' s you !
i hope it ' s you .
me too !
first of all um , i love you both so much and you ' re both so important to me
okay , bla - bla - bla - bla ! who is it !
well umm , i was thinking that maybe we could come up with a system where we trade off being maid of honor for each other .
like hypothetically , if phoebe were mine
yes ! oh !
hypothetically !
still .
if phoebe were my maid of honor
uh - hmm .
rachel would be phoebe ' s , i would be rachel ' s , that way we all get to do it once and no one would get upset .
yeah that ' s actually a pretty good idea .
yeah , i ' ll do that . so who gets to be yours ?
well that ' s the best part . umm ,
wh - why is that the best part ?
because then i don ' t have to !
well of
i ' m really not deciding !
fine !
yeah that ' s right .
aww , and good luck to you too ! what a nice lady !
if you wanna give joey a christmas present that disrupts the entire building , why not get him something a little bit more subtle , like a wrecking ball , or a phial of small pox to release in the hallway ?
it ' s not just the drum noise .
every five minutes , joey throws his sticks in the air , and i have to hear , " oh my eye !
oh god , my eye ! "
i mean , it is so annoying .
yes , thank you . you see , this is how normal people are supposed to react to drums .
phoebe , you got joey drums to annoy rachel , so she wouldn ' t wanna live there anymore ?
maybe on some level .
joey ? could you get that ? what are you doing here ? i thought you were in your room ?

um , then yes , it ' s ' cause of phoebe ! so , you know , it ' s either her or me .
you know . you ' re gonna be really , really hard to get over .
by the way , the week before your wedding you may not see a lot of me .
oh , hello liar .

i could ' ve been killed i hope you know !
i know . i know . but , can we please try it again ? huh ? i mean , you were

phoebe .
what ! what the hell !
all right , y ' know what ?
if you are not going to learn how to ride this bike then i ' m sorry , i ' m just gonna have to take it back .
what ! why !
because ! because , it - it - it ' s it ' d be like you having this guitar and - and never playing it . okay , this guitar
all right . if you care enough to make up that load of crap , okay .
great ! great ! you ' re making the bike very happy .
okay ross ! please don ' t die !
how could you have kept all of this from me ?
i was going to tell you , but
but what ! you figured you ' d get what you wanted and then dump her like you dumped rachel !
hey ! i did not dump rachel ! nor are we still together . can i just why don ' t we just let the machine get that ?
hey ross . it ' s joey . there ' s a hooker over here and we thought maybe you ' d know something about it .
no ! no ! no ! no ! no ! i - i - i - ii need to , i need to lie down .
everything on your application looks really goodohh !
just one last question umm , are you and your friends gonna be over here all the time like partying and hanging out ?
oh don ' t worry , i ' m not really a party girl .
whoa ! now look , don ' t be just blurtin ' stuff out . i want you to really think about your answers . okay ?
you can call off the roommate search ! hi ! i ' ll be living here .
oh don ' t listen to him , he ' s just some guy who really wants the apartment , but i don ' t think he ' s gonna get it .
why did you take the shower curtain down ?
that thing was a hazard ! i ' m very safety conscious .
hi .
hey man , how did the audition go ?
estelle said i didn ' t get it .
what ! why ? joey you were so ready for it !
yeah , i thought so too but , she said the casting people had some problems with me .
no !
for all i know , she ' s trying to find me but couldn ' t because i kept moving around .
no , from now on , i ' m staying in one place .
right here .
well , it ' s getting late .
yeah , we ' re gonna go .
actually , do you guys mind staying here for a while ?
ugh , y ' know , umm we gotta get up early and catch that plane for new york .
yeah , it ' s a very large plane .
that ' s cool .
but , we ' ll stay here with you .
thanks guys ! i really appreciate this , y ' know , but you don ' t have to rub my butt .
hey , mel gibson and clint eastwood .
they ' re not a couple !
oh - okay , i get the game now .
okay look , look , let me ask you a question , when they were doing it on stage , was it like really hot ?
oh yeah !
well okay , so then you ' re fine .
the rule is when two actors are actually doing it off - stage all the sexual tension between them is gone .
okay ?
so as long as it ' s hot onstage you got nothing to worry about .
it ' s when the heat goes away , that ' s when you ' re in trouble .
really ?
look , you guys have been to every play i ' ve ever been in , have i ever had chemistry on stage ?
no .
no !
ursula ! wait ! err - err , it ' s me ! phoebe !
oh , i thought there was a mirror there . okay , bye - bye .
wait a second ! so , what ' s new with you ?
umm , nothing . i mean , i ' m getting married next week .
and your breasts ! hmm !
okay .
umm look , you ' re coming on a little strong .
but i ' m going to give you the benefit of the doubt , because it seems the universe really wants to be together .
so , why don ' t we just start over okay ?
and you can just tell me about yourself .
all right .
okay .
i write erotic novels , for children .
what !
they ' re wildly unpopular .
oh my god !
oh also , you might be interested to know that i have a ph . d .
wow ! you do ?
yeah , a pretty huge
all right .
so , uh , how ' s she doing ?
the doctor says it ' s a matter of hours .
how - how are you , mom ?
me ? i ' m fine , fine . i ' m glad you ' re here . . what ' s with your hair ?
what ?
what ' s different ?
nothing .
oh , maybe that ' s it .
she is unbelievable , our mother is .
okay , relax , relax .
we are gonna be here for a while , it looks like , and we still have boyfriends and your career to cover .
oh god !
the fuzzy little mints at the bottom of her purse .
oh !
. yeah , they were gross .
oh , you know what i loved ?
her sweet ' n ' los .
how she was always stealing them from - from restaurants .
not just restaurants , from our house .
maybe .
you can ' t !
why ? seriously i did not understand a word that you said .
in the hall .
now , y ' see , most people , when their pets pass on , they want ' em sorta laid out like they ' re sleeping .
but occasionally you get your person who wants them in a pose .
like , chasing their tail , or , uh , jumping to catch a frisbee .
joey , if i go first , i wanna be looking for my keys .
that ' s a good one !
hey , joe .
dad , ronni ' s here .

and us , we ' ll be like , ' wh - whoa , dude . '

wait ! you ' re going out with kathy !
yeah . why are you getting so upset ?
well , i ' m upsetfor you . i mean , having sex with an endless line of beautiful women must be very unfulfilling for you .

yes , but y ' know what ?
it doesn ' t matter who knows what .
now , enough of us know that we can just tell them that we know !
then all the lying and the secrets would finally be over !
it ' s a tradition , like the parade . if the parade decided it was gay , moved out , and abandoned its entire family .
y ' know , you ' re friend ' s getting married , it ' s gotta change things .
you really think it would be that different ?
how could it not be ?
i mean pretty soon they ' re gonna be having kids , and then they ' re just gonna be hanging out with other couples who have kids .
and then maybe they ' re gonna have to leave the city to be near a

are they end to end , or tall like pancakes ?
y ' know what i mean , about how i ' m always going out with all these women .
and i always figured , when the right one comes along , i ' d be able to be a stand - up guy and go the distance , y ' know ?
now i ' m looking at my dad , thinking .
hey , you ' re not him .
you ' re you .
when they were all over you to go into your father ' s pipe - fitting business , did you cave ?
no .
no .
you decided to go into the out - of - work actor business .
now that wasn ' t easy , but you did it !
and i ' d like to believe that when the right woman comes along , you will have the courage and the guts to say " no thanks , i ' m married . "
you really think so ?
yeah . i really do .
thanks , chandler .
get off !
hi .
your fettuccini alfredo looks a little dry , did you use all your cheese ?

hey !
hey !
what are you doing ?
i ' m sending back all this stuff that chandler bought out of guilt .

hey , if they have a ball maybe you can stick razor blades in it and teach them a new game , gonna need stitches ball .
she said what ?
she said , " if i ' m not gonna be happy getting married somewhere that we find in a day , well then we should just postpone it . "
postpone it ?
emily , do you think monica realises how much our parents spent on this wedding ?
do you my sister ' s teeny - tiny little brain comprehends that people took time out of their lives to fly thousands of miles to be here , huh ?
this isn ' t right .
i realize that people are going to be disappointed . but , i ' m sure they ' ll come back when we can do it right .
i can ' t ask people to do that ? would you ask people to do that ?
don ' t you point your pants at me !
we have no choice !
anywhere that ' s half - decent would ' ve be booked months ago , ross don ' t you understand ?

so what are you saying ? it ' s now or never ?
no . i ' m saying it ' s now .
or ?
there ' s no or ' in mind . what is wrong with these pants !
it ' s not the pants .

where does that leave me ?
you get to be the baby ' s father .
everyone knows who you are .
who am i ?
there ' s mother ' s day , there ' s father ' s day , there ' s no . lesbian lover day .
every day is lesbian lover day .
this is so great .

i can ' t believe that ross is gone . it is just so sad .
i didn ' t know ross and you were so close .
we weren ' t but we had one class together . he was such a great guy and he talked so passionately about science . i always remembered him .
i ' m sure that would mean a lot to him .
and if heaven has a door , i ' m sure he ' s pressing his ear up against it and listening intently .
i thought so many times about calling him and asking him out . i guess i really missed my chance .
but you didn ' t !
i ' m still alive !
kori , i know this is a big surprise for you .
it ' s a long story but the things you just said really made my day !
i mean , the fact that you are here means more to me than if this room were filled with people !
you sick freak , who does that ? i can ' t believe i had a crush on you !
did you hear that ? kori weston had a crush on me !
we ' ll do a quick check .
okay .
so , eight days late huh ?
yeah .
you must be a little uncomfortable .
eh , just a tad .
you ' re about 80 percent effaced , so you ' re on your way .
it still could last a little while longer .
if you ' re anxious there are a few ways to help things along .
do them !
actually , they ' re things you can do . just some home remedies , but in my experience i ' ve found that some of them are quite effective .
well , we are ready to try anything .
okay , there ' s an herbal tea you can drink .
okay .
what is wrong with emma ?
oh she misunderstood , she thought she was moving to tulsa .
anytime you ' re ready .

just aim for the bump .
ok , ok , ok , ok , here goes .
you know , i , you know , can ' t do this .
uh , this is too weird .
i feel stupid .

oh , i know . y ' know , just - just talking about it is getting me kinda
oh , me too .
and then , we could ' ve gone from the ceremony to the reception with you in the sidecar !
ross , it just wouldn ' t have been feasible .
but having a dove place the ring on your finger would ' ve been no problem ?
it was really fun being married to you tonight .
yeah ! and ! and , it was the easiest 400 bucks i ' ve ever made .
okay ross , can i uh , can i ask you something ?

it wasreally wonderful !
did you just make that up ?
no , actually i thought about it when , when we were going out .
it ' s how i imagined i uh , i would ask you to marry me .
well , that would ' ve been very hard to say no too .
it ' s a good thing i didn ' t do it , because it sounds like it would ' ve been a very expensive wedding . okay , good night
goodnight
even if the sidecar had a windscreen so your hair wouldn ' t get messed up ?
i will think about it .
that ' s all i ' m askin '
you guys ! it was bananas , cream , and beef ! i - i just cannot believe that you ate that so that i wouldn ' t feel bad !

well , i , umm

or maybe he - he was writing to tell her that - that he ' s changed his name , y ' know ? tell monica i ' m sorry .
i think it means he freaked out and left !

ok , paulo , why don ' t you just go get dressed , and then you be on your way , ok , bye - bye .
rachel , how did this happen ?
i don ' t know , i just kinda ran into him last night .
where ?
at his apartment . is this juice ?
whoa , whoa . and the fact that you dumped him because he hit on phoebe ?
oh god , i know i ' m a pathetic loser .
i licked my arm , what ?
it ' s breast milk .
so ?
phoebe , that is juice , squeezed from a person .
what is the big deal ?
what did you just do ?
ok , would people stop drinking the breast milk ?
you won ' t even taste it ?
no !
not even if you just pretend that it ' s milk ?
not even if carol ' s breast had a picture of a missing child on it .
aww !
that ' s funny .
hey pheebs , could you please not put your feet up on my newold sheet ?
oh sure ! noo !
ohh !
my apothecary table !
what !
no !
ross , where did you get this !
i got it at
oh my god , phoebe ,
wow ! oh my god , well if they ' ve ripped off our table ours must be much more than one and fifty dollars !
oh yes .
well this doesn ' t even smell like opium .
of course not , it smells like wine , which you spilled ! and thanks for wrecking my sheet by the way .
oh ross , calm down , i ' ll give you the 80 cents .
how is she ?
it ' s too soon to tell . she ' s resting , which is a good sign .
how ' s the hair ?
i ' m not gonna lie to you , ross , it doesn ' t look good .
i put a clip on one side , which seems to have stopped the curling .
can we see her ?
your hair looks too good , i think it would upset her . ross , why don ' t you come on in .
yeah .
how ' re you doing ?
of course the packaging does appeal to grown - ups and kids alike .
ross , you ' re being silly . i ' ve tried it , it ' s no big deal . just taste it .
that would be no .
come on . it doesn ' t taste bad .
yeah , it ' s kinda sweet , sorta like , uh .
cantaloupe juice .
exactly .
you ' ve tasted it ? you ' ve tasted it .
uh huh .
oh , you ' ve tasted it .
you can keep saying it , but it won ' t stop being true .
gimme the bottle . gimme the towel .
i still don ' t get why greg and jenny would give us a fake number .
y ' know , if they knew what they were doing they probably didn ' t give you real names either .
okay , maybe people give out fake numbers , but they don ' t give out fake names .
oh yeah ? hi , ken adams , nice to meet you .
regina philange .

what ' s this ?
that ' s a dog , every house should have a dog .
not one that can pee on the roof .
well , maybe it ' s so big because the house was built on radioactive waste .
and is this in case the house sneezes ?
no , no , that ' s the ghost for the attic .
i don ' t want a ghost .
well , nobody wants a ghost . but you ' ve got one , because the house is sitting on an ancient indian burial ground .

so you can like , bite , and pull people ' s hair and stuff ?
yeah , anything goes , except ah , eye gouging and fish hooking .

huh , what ' s fish hooking . thanks man , that would have been really hard to describe . what is that taste ?
what ? my hands are totally clean , i just gave the duck a bath .
oh , bob , he was nothing compared to you . i had to bite my lip to keep from screaming your name .
well , that makes me feel so good .
it was just so awkward and bumpy .
bumpy ?
well , maybe he had some kind of uh , new , cool style , that you ' re not familiar with .
and uh maybe you have to get used to it .
well there really wasn ' t much time to get used to it , you know what i mean ?
coming through ! oh ! coming through ! oh ! hello ! hi ! no ! right ! coming through !

excuse me ?
joey ! he ' s working ! you would look
oh , how bad is it ?
oh , it ' s bad . it ' s really bad . the only thing in there that isn ' t burned is an ass . which i do
how ' s your room rach ?
everything ' s ruined . my bed . my clothes . look at my favorite blue sweater .
isn ' t that mine ?
fine ! i ' m sorry for your loss !
so uh , you ' re not gonna be able to live here for a while , you ladies have a place to stay ?
wow ! oh - okay , look pal , i am
yes , they can stay with us .
have you figured out what started the fire mr . fireman ?
there ' s just so much pressure .
i mean no offense , but what you guys do is very different .
i don ' t know if you ' d understand .
yeah , none of us have to deal with pressure at our jobs .
well phoebe , we gotta do something !
well , y ' know .
i mean there ' s no way joey ' s gonna make it in time .
so i ' m gonna go through the hotel and see if there ' s any other weddings going on .
okay . oh but don ' t tell them monica ' s pregnant because they frown on that .
okay .
okay .
what ' s all this about you guys fighting ! is this really over a room ! i mean , that is so silly !
ross , we can handle this .
well , apparently not , and i can ' t just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly .
i mean , enough of the silliness !
well , why don ' t you tell her to stop being silly !
okay - okay !
two very good points , look i ' ve known you both a long time , and i ' ve never seen either of you one / millionth as happy as you ' ve been since you ' ve got together .
do you really want to throw that all away over a room ?
that is so silly .
now wh - what is more important , love or silliness ?
well , we are fond of the silliness , but we also have a soft spot for the love .
love is the best medicine .
that ' s laughter .
why do you do it ?
i don ' t know .
okay ! all right ! now , chandler you - you wanna live with monica , right ?
yeah , i do .
and mon , you wanna live with chandler , don ' t ya ?
yes .

oh .
but i don ' t . me , phoebe .
well , i ' m not i ' m not at all surprised they feel that way .
you ' re not ? see , that ' s why you ' re so great !
actually it ' s , it ' s quite , y ' know , typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic .
y ' know , this kind of co - dependant , emotionally stunted , sitting in your stupid coffee house with your stupid big cups which , i ' m sorry , might as well have nipples on them , and you ' re like all ' oh , define me !
define me !
love me , i need love !
' .
have you really done this before ?
yeah !

hey , dragon ! here ' s your tips from monday and tuesday .
there ' s like - there ' s like 300 bucks in this one !
yeah , people get pretty generous around the holidays . and it never hurts to wear tight trousers .
okay .
could the waiters gather around to hear tonight ' s specials ?
okay , first there is a chilean sea bass prepared with a mango relish on a bagwhy is nobody writing these down ?

okay , look , ross , i realise that my father is difficult , but that ' s why you have got to be the bigger man here .
look sweetie , i could be the bigger man , i could be the biggest man , i could be a big , huge , giant man , and it still wouldn ' t make any difference , except that i could pick your father up and say like me !

rachel one brunch is not gonna solve anything . you gotta face it , okay we ' re never gonna get along .

if you ' re afraid of bugs . get a bug .

oh ? why not ?
it ' s the semi - finalsof herbotchy ball tournament .
what ' s going on bing ? does uh , your wife have a problem with me or something ?
well now - now you ' re just talking crazy .
so why can ' t the three of us go out together ?
because uhwe - wewe split up . monica and i split up . hold me .
good god bing iwell i can ' t say i ' m altogether surprised , i saw the way she looked at you , and there was no love there .
and the way she looked at me , pure lust .
y ' know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something . can i choke ya ?
bing my boy , we ' re gonna get you over this .
now here ' s the plan , grab your coat , we ' re going to a strip club .
oh no - no - no , monica would freak . but to hell with that bitch .

there you go sweetie . this isn ' t over .
did he call ?

maybe he ' s intimated by really smart , strong , successful women .
sophie , would you please climb out of my butt . why hasn ' t he called , rachel ? why ?
okay , okay . umm , well ah , maybe he , maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss .
awkward ? why should he feel awkward ?
well .
the only person that should feel awkward is you , and you didn ' t tell him not to call me , did you ?
no . i .
because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for , there are always ways to fix . that .
and you ' re upset because you didn ' t make your best friend cry ?
i mean , all i ' m asking for is just a little emotion !
is that too much to ask after six years !

no that ' s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone .
