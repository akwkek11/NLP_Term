it was just so awkward and bumpy .
bumpy ?

well phoebe , we gotta do something !

i mean there ' s no way joey ' s gonna make it in time .
so i ' m gonna go through the hotel and see if there ' s any other weddings going on .
okay . oh but don ' t tell them monica ' s pregnant because they frown on that .
okay .
okay .
what ' s all this about you guys fighting ! is this really over a room ! i mean , that is so silly !
ross , we can handle this .
well , apparently not , and i can ' t just stand by and watch two people i care about very much be hurt over something that is so silly .
i mean , enough of the silliness !
well , why don ' t you tell her to stop being silly !
okay - okay !
two very good points , look i ' ve known you both a long time , and i ' ve never seen either of you one / millionth as happy as you ' ve been since you ' ve got together .
do you really want to throw that all away over a room ?
that is so silly .
now wh - what is more important , love or silliness ?
well , we are fond of the silliness , but we also have a soft spot for the love .
love is the best medicine .
that ' s laughter .
why do you do it ?
i don ' t know .

well , i ' m not i ' m not at all surprised they feel that way .
you ' re not ? see , that ' s why you ' re so great !
actually it ' s , it ' s quite , y ' know , typical behaviour when you have this kind of dysfunctional group dynamic .

oh right , yeah okay , my mom could , and i can ' t . we don ' t have that .
where there is no fear of commitment .
do we have any . do we have any thoughts here ?
well , i ' ve never been through the tunnel myself , ' cause as i understand it , you ' re not allowed to go through with more than one girl in the car , right .
but , it seems to me it ' s pretty much like anything else , you know , face your fear .
it have a fear of heights , you go to the top of the building !
if you ' re afraid of bugs . get a bug .
right .
in this case , you have a fear of commitment , so i say you go in there and be the most committed guy there ever was .
amazingly , that makes sense .
you think ?
oh , yeah . go for it man , jump off the high dive , stare down the barrel of the gun , pee into the wind !
yeah , joe , i assure you if i ' m staring down the barrel of a gun , i ' m pretty much peeing every which way .
hey ! hey !

i ' m missin ' picture time !
y ' know she has a face ross !
okay . okay , here ' s a good one of us .

i mean , i don ' t feel like i even have a girlfriend anymore .
you want me to just quit my job so that you can feel like you ' ve got a girlfriend ?
is this about mark ?
oh my god .

let ' s ah , let ' s take a break , let ' s cool off , okay , let ' s get some frozen yoghurt , or something .
no . a break from us .
bing ! we ' re all set for tonight , 8 o ' clock .
oh uh , as it turns out , we can ' t do it . monica has to work .
oh , my ex - wife didn ' t work , unless you call turning into her mother work . fine . tomorrow night then .
oh uh well tomorrow ' s no good for her either .
oh ? why not ?
it ' s the semi - finalsof herbotchy ball tournament .
what ' s going on bing ? does uh , your wife have a problem with me or something ?
well now - now you ' re just talking crazy .
so why can ' t the three of us go out together ?
because uhwe - wewe split up . monica and i split up . hold me .
good god bing iwell i can ' t say i ' m altogether surprised , i saw the way she looked at you , and there was no love there .
and the way she looked at me , pure lust .
y ' know what would really help me through this tough time is choking something . can i choke ya ?
bing my boy , we ' re gonna get you over this .
now here ' s the plan , grab your coat , we ' re going to a strip club .
oh no - no - no , monica would freak . but to hell with that bitch .
look at you , all sweet and innocent , sleeping like an angel . with emma ' s chubby little hands wrapped around ya .
it ' s okay , emma , you stay asleep .
: step away from the crib , i have a weapon !
it ' s okay , it ' s okay rach , it ' s me . put down the scrunchy .
what are you doing ?
well , i heard emma stirring , so i came to make sure she could reach hugsy .
oh , oh thanks . alright well , now that i ' m up i ' m going to go to the bathroom .
there you go sweetie . this isn ' t over .
did he call ?
no . sorry .
why ! why ! he said he ' d call . why hasn ' t he called ?
maybe he ' s intimated by really smart , strong , successful women .
sophie , would you please climb out of my butt . why hasn ' t he called , rachel ? why ?
okay , okay . umm , well ah , maybe he , maybe he feels awkward because you are my boss .
awkward ? why should he feel awkward ?
well .
the only person that should feel awkward is you , and you didn ' t tell him not to call me , did you ?
no . i .
because if you feel uncomfortable with your friend dating someone you work for , there are always ways to fix . that .
and you ' re upset because you didn ' t make your best friend cry ?
i mean , all i ' m asking for is just a little emotion !
is that too much to ask after six years !
i mean what ?
are - are - are rachel and i not as close as you guys !
i mean do we not have as much fun !
don ' t i deserve a few tears !
i mean we - we told joey , he cried his eyes out !
hey !
i did not cry my eyes out !
come on !
it ' s like the end of an era !
no more j - man and channie ' s !

what , you didn ' t get it ? the doctor is a monkey .
and monkeys can ' t write out prescriptions .
you are not allowed to laugh at my joke .
your joke ? well , i think the hef ' would disagree , which is why he sent me a check for one hundred ah - dollars .
i can ' t find garbage bags !
oh , i think i saw some in here .
what is it !
i don ' t know ! but maybe if we keep that drawer shut , it ' ll die .
i can ' t believe we ' re living here !
you still havent told rachel you werent really proposing ?
no ! she had the ring on , she seemed so excited , and then she took her breast out .
joey , you have to tell her whats going on ! and what did it look like !
i didnt look at it . stupid babys head was blocking most of it .
go and tell rachel right now before ross finds out .
look , its not that easy . she said she wanted to marry me . i dont want to hurt her .
okay , look , just do it gently .
youre right .

i - ill go tell her now before ross finds out and ill be gentle .
i can do that .
i am a gentle person .
oh , by the way .
two people screwing in there if you want to check that out .

yeah , maybe .
and i - i am just trying to figure out why .

it was in my room all night !
and if she didn ' t take it , and i didn ' t take it ; and you didn ' t take it , then who did ?

i thought i was making him filet mignon ?
yeah , you were , but you decided to make salmon because you had some left over at the restaurant .
and then you realised if you bitched about it , then you would stop cooking , and you would have to make your famous baked potato and diet coke .

good .
although y ' know , he - he ' s a private guy .
y ' know , i wish i could get him to open up a little bit , share some feelings .
that ' s easy ! you just have to think of him as a - as a jar of pickles that won ' t open .
so what are you saying ; i should run him under hot water and bang his head against a table ?
no that ' s what you do when you want to get the truth out of someone .
hi honey .
hi !
